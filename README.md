Usage:

1. Download this project and open index.html in the browser. You will be prompted with a file selection.
2. Choose a json file that matches the format of example_load_data.json (I recommend editing this file directly and choosing it since its already complete)
3. A calendar will be generated with everything on it. You can press your print keybind (Mac is `command + p`, windows is `ctrl + p`) to get this file as a pdf.
